# BabylonJS-CharacterController

A 3rd person CharacterController for use in [BabylonJS](http://www.babylonjs.com/) (a 3D HTML Webgl framework) applications.  
It uses the collider and moveWithCollision() function to move the character around. It uses some of the physics kinematic equations to calculate movements like jump, fall, slide. It does not use any physics engine. It does not react to or apply forces.  
For demo see  
<a href="https://ssatguru.github.io/BabylonJS-CharacterController-Samples/demo/" target="_blank">https://ssatguru.github.io/BabylonJS-CharacterController-Samples/demo/</a>

## About

It currently supports

- idle
- idleJump
- walk
- walkBack
- run
- runJump
- fall
- turnRight
- turnLeft
- strafeLeft
- strafeRight
- slideDown

It supports constraining avatar from traversing slopes inclined at certain angles.

It also supports camera "elasticity". In other words if a mesh comes between the camera and avatar/player, the camera snaps to
a position in front of the mesh. This way the avatar/player is always in view.

It can also enter first person view if the camera comes very close to the avatar/player

### Breaking change with 0.2.0

Instead of "jump" animation it expects "idleJump" and "runJump" animations.

Version 0.2.0 converts the project from a plain vanilla JavaScript project to a module based JavaScript project.  
With this change, the way to load the application has changed.  
In JavaScript, instead of

```
var CharacterControl = org.ssatguru.babylonjs.component.CharacterController;
var characterControl = new CharacterControl(player,camera,scene);
```

now do

```
var characterControl = new CharacterController(player,camera,scene);
```

In TypeScript, instead of

```
import CharacterController = org.ssatguru.babylonjs.component.CharacterController;
```

now do

```
import {CharacterController} from "babaylonjs-charactercontroller";
```

See below for more details.

## Quick start

1. add the following dependencies

```
<script src="https://cdn.babylonjs.com/babylon.js"></script>
<script src="CharacterController.js"></script>
```

See INSTALL below to find where you can get "CharacterController.js". 

2. if your mesh rotation is in quaternion then switch to euler.  
NOTE: The GLTF/GLB files have rotation in quaternion
```
// character controller  needs rotation in euler.
// if your mesh has rotation in quaternion then convert that to euler.
player.rotation = player.rotationQuaternion.toEulerAngles();
player.rotationQuaternion = null;

```

3. instantiate charcater controller and start it.

```
  //------------------Character Controller -------------------------------------------------
  //fourth parm agMap is optional and is used when animation groups rather than animation ranges 
  //are used.
  var cc = new CharacterController(player,camera,scene,agMap);
  cc.start();
```

see "BabylonJS-CharacterController-Samples" [https://github.com/ssatguru/BabylonJS-CharacterController-Samples](https://github.com/ssatguru/BabylonJS-CharacterController-Samples) for a few simple samples to help you get going

## INSTALL

You can get the "CharacterController.min.js" from its git repository "dist" folder or "releases" section  
[https://github.com/ssatguru/BabylonJS-CharacterController/tree/master/dist](https://github.com/ssatguru/BabylonJS-CharacterController/tree/master/dist)  
[https://github.com/ssatguru/BabylonJS-CharacterController/releases](https://github.com/ssatguru/BabylonJS-CharacterController/releases)

You can also install it from npm

```
npm install babylonjs-charactercontroller
```

## Usage

This has been built as an UMD module which means you can use it as a CommonJS/NodeJS module, AMD module or as a global object
loaded using the script tag.

Project "BabylonJS-CharacterController-Samples" [https://github.com/ssatguru/BabylonJS-CharacterController-Samples](https://github.com/ssatguru/BabylonJS-CharacterController-Samples) has a
collection of sample projects to show how to use this from TypeScript, NodeJs, AMD or plain vanilla JavaScript applications.

Below is a quick summary of how you can use this as different module types.

TypeScript

```
// TypeScript
import * as BABYLON from "babylonjs";
import {CharacterController} from "babylonjs-charactercontroller";
...
let engine = new BABYLON.Engine(canvas, true);
...
let cc = new CharacterController(player,camera,scene);
```

CommonJS/NodeJS Module

```
let BABYLON = require("babylonjs");
let CharacterController = require("babylonjs-CharacterController").CharacterController;
...
let engine = new BABYLON.Engine(canvas, true);
...
let characterController = new CharacterController(player,camera,scene);
...

```

AMD Module

```
<script src="./lib/require.js"></script>
<script>
	require.config({
		baseUrl: ".",
		paths: {
			"babylonjs": "./lib/babylon",
			"ec": "./lib/CharacterController"
		}
	});

	require(['babylonjs', 'cc'], function (BABYLON, cc) {
		let CharacterController = ec.CharacterController;
    ...
		let engine = new BABYLON.Engine(canvas, true);
		...
		let characterController = new CharacterController(player,camera,scene);
		...
	});
</script>
```

Global Module

```
<script src="./lib/babylon.js"></script>
<script src="./lib/CharacterController.js"></script>
<script>
  ...
	let engine = new BABYLON.Engine(canvas, true);
	...
	let characterController = new CharacterController(player,camera,scene);
	...
</script>
```

## API

#### To Instantiate

```
// JavaScript

// if using animation ranges
var cc = new CharacterController(player,camera,scene);

// if using animation groups
var cc = new CharacterController(player,camera,scene,agMap);
//agMap is a Map of animation name to animationGroup
```

```
// TypeScript

import {CharacterController} from "babylonjs-charactercontroller";

// if using animation ranges
let cc = new CharacterController(player,camera,scene);

// if using animation groups
var cc = new CharacterController(player,camera,scene,agMap);

```

Takes four parms

- player - the player mesh containing a skeleton with appropriate animations listed below
- camera - arc rotate camera
- scene - scene
- agMap - This is optional and only needed if using animation groups instead of animation ranges.
    It is a Map of animation name to animationGroup
	In this Map the key would be the character controller animation name and
    the key value would be the animationGroup.  
     example:
```	 
   	let myWalkAnimationGroup:AnimationGroup = ...;
    let agMap:{} = {
    	"walk":myWalkAnimationGroup,
     	"run": ...,
    }
```	 

If using animation ranges the player skeleton is expected to have the following animation ranges named as follows

- idle
- idleJump
- walk
- walkBack
- run
- runJump
- fall
- turnRight
- turnLeft
- strafeLeft
- strafeRight
- slideDown

If your animation range is named differently from those mentioned above then use the setWalkAnim(..),setWalkBackAnim(..) etc API to specify your animation range name.

NOTE : 
If your mesh rotation is in quaternion then switch to euler before creating character controller.
The GLTF/GLB files have rotation in quaternion.  

```
player.rotation = player.rotationQuaternion.toEulerAngles();
player.rotationQuaternion = null;
```

#### To start/stop controller

```
cc.start();
cc.stop();
```

#### To change animation range name / animation group and their parameters
rangeName can be the name of your animation range corresponding to the character controller animation  
or it could be the animation group corresponding to the character controller animation 

```
cc.setIdleAnim(rangeName: string|AnimationGroup ,rate: number,loop: boolean);
cc.setIdleJumpAnim(rangeName: string,rate: number,loop: boolean);

cc.setWalkAnim(name :string|AnimationGroup , playback rate:number,loop:boolean);
cc.setWalkBackAnim(name :string, playback rate:number,loop:boolean);

cc.setRunAnim(name :string|AnimationGroup , playback rate:number,loop:boolean);
cc.setRunJumpAnim(rangeName: string,rate: number,loop: boolean)

cc.setFallAnim(name :string|AnimationGroup , playback rate:number,loop:boolean);

cc.setTurnRightAnim(name :string|AnimationGroup , playback rate:number,loop:boolean);
cc.setTurnLeftAnim(name :string|AnimationGroup , playback rate:number,loop:boolean);

cc.setStrafeRightAnim(name :string|AnimationGroup , playback rate:number,loop:boolean);
cc.setStrafeLeftAnim(name :string|AnimationGroup , playback rate:number,loop:boolean);

cc.setSlideBackAnim(name :string|AnimationGroup , playback rate:number,loop:boolean);
```

So lets say your walk animation is called "myWalk" and you want to play it at half speed and loop it continuoulsy then

```
cc.setWalkAnim("myWalk",0.5,true);
//if you donot want to change the name or the rate the use below instead
cc.setWalkAnim(null,null,true);
```

#### To change key binding

By default the controller uses WASDQE, space and arrow keys to controll your player/avatar.

- w-walk forward
- Shit+w-run
- CapsLock- run
- s-walk backward
- a-turn left
- d-turn right
- q-strafe left
- e-strafe right.
- " " - jump

To change these use

```
cc.setWalkKey(string:key);
cc.setWalkBackKey(string:key);
cc.setTurnLeftKey(string:key);
cc.setTurnRightKey(string:key);
cc.setStrafeLeftKey(string:key);
cc.setStrafeRightKey(string:key);
cc.setJumpKey(string:key);
```

You can specify both key or a keycode.

#### To change gravity or speed at which avatar/player is moved

Speed is specified in meters/second

```
setGravity(n: number);    //default 9.8 m/s^2
setWalkSpeed(n: number);  //default 3 m/s
setRunSpeed(n: number);   //default 6 m/s
setBackSpeed(n: number);  //default 3 m/s
setJumpSpeed(n: number);  //default 6 m/s
setLeftSpeed(n: number);  //default 3 m/s
setRightSpeed(n: number); //default 3 m/s
```

#### To change the slope the avatar can traverse

```
setSlopeLimit(minSlopeLimit: number,maxSlopeLimit: number); //the slope is specified in degrees
```

Example

```
setSlopeLimit(45,55);
```

Here if the avatar is on a slope with angle between 45 and 55 degrees then it will start sliding back when it stops moving.  
If the slope is 55 or more then avatar will not be able to move up on it.

#### To change the height of steps the avatar can climb

```
setStepOffset(stepOffset: number);
```

Example

```
setStepOffset(0.5);
```

The avatar can only move up a step if the height of the step is less than or equal to the "stepOffset".  
By default the value is 0.25.

#### To change avatar or skeleton at

```
setAvatar(avatar: Mesh);
setAvatarSkeleton(skeleton: Skeleton);
```

#### To change camera behavior

By default the camera focuses on the avatar/player origin. To focus on a different position on the avatar/player use

```
setCameraTarget(v: Vector3);
```

Lets say your avatar origin is at its feet but instead of focusing on its feet you would like camera to focus on its head then, assuming the the head is 1.5m above ground, you would do

```
cc.setCameraTarget(new BABAYLON.Vector3(0,1.5,0);
```

By default the camera behaves "elastically". In other words if something comes between the camera and avatar the camera snaps to
a position in front of that something. This way the avatar/player is always in view.
To turn this off use

```
setCameraElasticity(false);
```

You can use the arc rotate camera's "lowerRadiusLimit" and "upperRadiusLimit" property to controll how close or how far away from the avatar the camera can get.  
Example setting

```
camera.lowerRadiusLimit=2;
camera.upperRadiusLimit=20;
```

will restrict the camera between 2 and 20m from the avatar/player.  
When the camera comes to the "lowerRadiusLimit" the controller switches to first person view. In other words it makes the avatar/player invisible and the camera collision is disabled. Pulling camera back restores the third person view.
To prevent this use

```
setNoFirstPerson(true);
```

## Build

If not already installed, install node js.  
Switch to the project folder.  
Run "npm install", once, to install all the dependencies.  
### To build   
Run "npm build"  
This will both compile, minify and store the build in "dist" folder.  
### To test
1) start the development server  
"npm run dev"  
This will start the live dev server on port 8080.  
This will live compile your code any time you make changes and make your library available at
http://localhost:8080  

2) start another http server from the project root folder say on port 8181.  
goto http://localhost:8181/tst
to serve the index.html file for testing.  
The test html files pulls the library from http://localhost:8080 as shown in previous step.
